  goals:
    - Build features according to the latest PRD in /memory_bank.
    - Reference architecture diagrams when making structural decisions.
    - Maintain consistency with terminology in the glossary.
  
  context:
    # Automatically load these files when coding
    - memory_bank/PRD_V1.md
    - memory_bank/architecture_diagram.md
    - memory_bank/glossary.md
  
  do:
    - Keep the code modular and readable.
    - Document new modules with concise docstrings.
    - Update PRD comments if new architectural choices differ from the plan.

  don’t:
    - Modify the PRD directly.
    - Include deprecated MVP files unless explicitly asked.
    - Assume all old memory bank info is still relevant.
